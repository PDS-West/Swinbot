Quick Overview:

Stable is 100% working code. Stable only merges with beta

Beta Is common dev branch we will merge to and from.

Feel free to add/delete any extra branches as you see fit.

e.g I have my "lars working branch" which i will store what ever im working on at the moment,
once i have something finished and atleast semi working, ill "commit" it to beta. and then re sync beta to my branch
so im up-to-date with you code

There are two versions of the program
The "Github for windows" is a flashy wrapper around git that is easy to use but does little (at end of page)
"Git" is the proper software that has everything (I use the GUI but there is a bash aswell)a

And a great guide to git is here:
It is in bash, but really easy and explains the concepts great. just use the gui version after u learn the concepts.
